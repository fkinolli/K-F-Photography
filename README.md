# casWebsite
Please don't

This is a site I am working on, it is between me and Pavlos Wagner. We have decided that he will be the one mostly working on things like the photography side of the website, and I would work on the website side of the website while we both would try to contribute to each side.

There was a previous attempt made, which sadly got lost through the updating of windows. So now starting at square one, I thought it best to put this on GitHub as way of having a safe space to work, as well as constant backups.

Hopefully, this goes well, otheriwse I have no clue what I am going to do as a CAS Project.
